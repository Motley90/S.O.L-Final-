|_________________________________________________________|


Manaually create a max variable for generated scripts. So far there is only two. We reset the player back to the first for now.

Delete the player from the table function in the generated script. 

Add a library to enable and disable the script generation as well on player join and leaving the script is started and wrote when the player leaves. 
This was done intentionally to prevent adding a system and needs to be implimented. 
Eventually set the gamemode editor and script generator to be able to disconnect from the source by calling dofile at any time. 
And reloadscripts when all players leave the server. Should be a simple add. I should call this anyway when no player are online. 

Get into fade screen on data handeling between scripts. The standard library for fadescreen is broken when a player reconnects. 
Test if the audio still goes to zero after a reconnect. If so we will use gui but still call the function for that very reason. 


-----------
At this point clean up the scripts. Rename some stuff and test the system again. If nothing got broken we can move past this point. 
-----------

Add camera functions. Add to the timer the ability to move the camera around. Review camera controls in Controls.nut.
We will not check if camera position made it from one, then two, etc. We will get how many incriments it takes to get to that point.
The timer can handle that and will be clean versus the script trying to fix itself by trying to go to exact vectors. Server side but ideally converted to client side at a later date

Review everything in game 

------------

Bots might be coming. Review the actor options, review 2016 source "early production for animations script". It had some fancy features.
But needs to be reworked. 

Review the source in game. Should have a solid source as a base of operations. 
If bots happen I want to be able to generate scripts that can handle the bots around the server doing random things. 
As lets not manually write that. 
Bots could literally do a mission as if it looks like a player is doing it. I just need to make them travel to spheres.
Constantly adding checks and what not

------------

Constantly review the source. Check out data handeling. Anything that can be optimized. The editor has some known bugs. But other than that this is the max push.

The code generator needs some cleaning up. I removed functions at the end of the generated scripts manually. Just review the script parser lol.

Also fix indenting xD.

--------------

Create basic gamemodes with every feature as a test and see if evenrything works before assuming.
--------------
Generate some random shit

I don't mind editing generated scripts. 

Try to configure a way to load specific scripts in game if a player enters a sphere. Maybe show a gui and if anything is clicked load that script for the player
Good for peramedic, police, whatever. 

At a later date a proper screen vector incriment will be added to be able to constantly add without manually adding stuff after.
