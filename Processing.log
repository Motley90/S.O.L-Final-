Going to work in a gui to fill the screen as a fade screen method.
I guess create a sepereate file for it in the windows folder.
GUI screen size is screen width and height of the players game res.

Add to window library branch "FadeScreen-Server.nut, FadeScreen-Client.nut".
Add to server mission timer the ability to change the alpha value.
Add to the script generator a fade screen bool variable for the server timer to start handling when trigered. 
I think all generated scripts should have the bool set to unfade when it is loaded for the player.

I think the client should really have a variable call to the server that the window alpha was fully set.
The next cript being automatically loaded should be yeilded. 

I don't have intentions of forcing missions to auto load in the future. This is added as a test to the system and functions to use for later on.
Even on a random load I would just fade the screen, handle setting data like the players skin, spawning things etc before unfading so the player does not see these things.
